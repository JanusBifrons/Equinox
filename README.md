# Equinox

Equinox is a 2D top-down space shooter.

Equinox is heavily inspired by EVE Online, The Violet Sector and The Space Game and mixes mechanics from all whilst blending in new concepts.

This project is simply a vertical slice of the game featuring a single-player only version of what will hopfully one day be a fully completed MMO with a single
universe much like EVE Online spread over multiple sectors and systems allowing for a instanced style architecture.
